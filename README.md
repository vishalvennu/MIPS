# MIPS
Implementation of MIPS five stage pipeline in C++

This project is a cycle-accurate simulator for a 5-stage pipelined
MIPS processor in C++. The simulator supports a subset of the MIPS instruction set and 
models the execution of each instruction with cycle accuracy.
The MIPS program is provided to the simulator as a text file “imem.txt” file which is used to
initialize the Instruction Memory. Each line of the file corresponds to a Byte stored in the
Instruction Memory in binary format, with the first line at address 0, the next line at address 1
and so on. Four contiguous lines correspond to a whole instruction. Note that the words stored
in memory are in “Big-Endian” format, meaning that the most significant byte is stored first.
The Data Memory is initialized using the “dmem.txt” file. The format of the stored words is the
same as the Instruction Memory. As with the instruction memory, the data memory addresses
also begin at 0 and increment by one in each line.
The instructions that the simulator supports and their encodings are shown in Table 1. Note that
all instructions, except for “halt”, exist in the MIPS ISA. The MIPS Green Sheet defines the
semantics of each instruction. 

Addu R-Type (ALU) 
Subu R-Type (ALU) 
Lw I-Type (Memory) 
Sw I-Type (Memory) 
Beq I-Type (Control) 
Halt Custom instruction

Above are the instructions supported by the Pipelined MIPS processor.
